This repository is for ARTDM 172, or Web Design 2, at Diablo Valley College.
My name is Kristina Algas, and this is my repository. Repository is such a strange word, isn't it? I mean, you hear about making deposits all the time, but a reposit is just unheard of! Here's what Miriam Webster has to say about the word "reposit":
## reposit (verb)
ri-ˈpä-zət : deposit, store (e.g., "The radioactive waste will be stored on-site until it can be *reposited* elsewhere.")
