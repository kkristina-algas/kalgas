## About Me
My name is Kristina Algas, and this is my repository for ARTDM 172. I am 23 years old. I have a particularly strong interest in botany and plant conservation, and I keep a modest collection of indoor plants at home. In my spare time, I like to draw, play video games (City Skylines 1 is my current favorite), and lift weights. My favorite D&D class is Wizard (specifically with the **portent** ability you get from the Divination subclass at level 3).
