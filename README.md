# Welcome to my Repository!
This repository is for ARTDM 172, or Web Design 2, at Diablo Valley College.

## About Me
My name is Kristina Algas, and this is my repository for ARTDM 172. I am 23 years old. I have a particularly strong interest in botany and plant conservation, and I keep a modest collection of indoor plants at home. In my spare time, I like to draw, play video games (City Skylines 1 is my current favorite), and lift weights. My favorite D&D class is Wizard (specifically with the **portent** ability you get from the Divination subclass at level 3).

I chose to enroll at DVC after obtaining my Bachelor's in Communications because-- let's be real-- the job market is rough these days. It's going to be a long, long, *long* while before we even have a chance of seeing a decent job market. So, I thought: "Why sit around and waste my time spamming out job applications when I could be picking up valuable skills?" That's why I'm here now: to learn new things, make connections, and prepare for the next big opportunity that comes my way.

## What is a "repository", anyways?
Repository is such a strange word, isn't it? I mean, you hear about making deposits all the time, but a reposit is just unheard of! Here's what Miriam Webster has to say about the word "reposit":
# reposit (verb)
ri-ˈpä-zət : deposit, store (e.g., "The radioactive waste will be stored on-site until it can be **reposited** elsewhere.")
From this definition, we can conclude that a "repository" is a place where previous versions of files are *reposited* for editing and viewing, kind of like the Version History tool in Google Docs.
