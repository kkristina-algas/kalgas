This repository is for ARTDM 172, or Web Design 2, at Diablo Valley College.
My name is Kristina Algas, and this is my repository for ARTDM 172. I am 23 years old. I have a particularly strong interest in botany and plant conservation, and I keep a modest collection of indoor plants at home. In my spare time, I like to draw, play video games (City Skylines 1 is my current favorite), and lift weights. My favorite D&D class is Wizard (specifically with the **portent** ability you get from the Divination subclass at level 3).

Repository is such a strange word, isn't it? I mean, you hear about making deposits all the time, but a reposit is just unheard of! Here's what Miriam Webster has to say about the word "reposit":
## reposit (verb)
ri-ˈpä-zət : deposit, store (e.g., "The radioactive waste will be stored on-site until it can be **reposited** elsewhere.")
